# Shell Sort

ShellSort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort. In insertion sort, we move elements only one position ahead. When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are involved. The idea of shellSort is to allow exchange of far items. In shellSort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1. An array is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every hâ€™th element is sorted.

Time Complexity: Time complexity of the above implementation of Shell sort is O(n2). In the above implementation, the gap is reduced by half in every iteration. There are many other ways to reduce gaps which leads to better time complexity. See this for more details.

- In place algorithm
- Difficult to nail down the time complexity because it will depend on the gap, worts case : O(n2), but it can perform much better than that like O(n)
- Doesn't require as much shifting as insertion sort, so it usually performs better
- Unstable algorithm
